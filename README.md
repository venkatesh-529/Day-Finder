A simple application that determines the day of the week for a given valid date.

## Description
This project takes a valid date as input (day, month, year) and calculates the corresponding day (Monday, Tuesday, etc.).  
It helped me understand date validation, logical conditions, and basic algorithmic thinking.

## Features
