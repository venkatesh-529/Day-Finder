# Day Finder

A simple program that determines the day of the week for a given valid date.

## Description
This project takes a valid date as input (day, month, year) and calculates the corresponding day (Monday, Tuesday, etc.).  
It helped me understand date validation, logical conditions, and basic algorithmic thinking.

## Features
- Accepts a valid date as input
- Calculates the correct day of the week
- Handles different months and years correctly

## Concepts Used
- Conditional logic
- Date validation
- Modular arithmetic / logical calculations

## How to Run
1. Compile the program
2. Run it
3. Enter a valid date when prompted


## What I Learned
- How to validate input before processing
- Breaking a real-world problem into smaller logical steps
- Importance of edge cases while working with dates
